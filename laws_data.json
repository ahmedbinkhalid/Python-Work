A has committed no offence.  \n  \n(b) A an officer of a Court of Justice, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y and after due enquiry, \nbelieving Z to be Y arrests Z. A has committed no offence.  \n  \n \n  \n77. Act of Judge when acting judicially:  \nNothing is an offence which is done by a Judge when acting judicially in the exercise of any power \nwhich is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to him by law.  \n  \n78.

A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment, \nexerted in good faith of the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murders in the \nact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper authorities. A has commi tted no offence, though it \nmay turn out that Z was acting in selfdefence.  \n  \n80. Accident in doing a lawful act:  \nNothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, and without any criminal intention or \nknowledge in the doing of a lawful  act in a lawful manner by lawful means and with proper care and \ncaution.   \nIllustration  \nA is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here if there was no \nwant of proper caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence.  \n  \n81. Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm:  \nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause \nharm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose \nof preventing or avoiding other harm to person or pro perty.  \nExplanation:  It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was \nof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge \nthat it was likely to cause harm.  \n \nIllustrati ons (a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds \nhimself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a \nboat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board; unless he cha nges the course of his vessel, \nand that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two \npassengers on board, which he may possibly clear Here, if A alters his course without any \nintention to run down the boat C and in goo d faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the \npassengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat C by \ndoing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that \nthe dan ger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him incurring the risk of running \ndown C.  \n  \n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He \ndoes this with the intention in good faith of savin g human life or property. Here, if it be found \nthat the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to excuse A's act, A is \nnot guilty of the offence.  \n  \n \n  \n82. Act of a child under seven years of age:  \nNothing is an offence, which is done by a child under seven years of age.  \n  \n83. Act of a child above seven and under twelve of immature understanding:  \nNothing is an offence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who ha s \nnot attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his \nconduct on that occasion.  \n  \n84.

This agreement implies the consent of each \nto suffer any harm which in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, \nwhile playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence.  \n  \n88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person's benefit:  \nNothing, which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may \ncause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be l ikely to cause, to any \nperson for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or \nimplied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of that harm.   \nIllustration  \nA, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is li kely to cause of death of Z, who suffers under \nthe painful complaint, but not intending to cause Z's death, and intending, in good faith for Z's \nbenefit, performs that operation on Z with Z's consent.

Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent:  \nNothing an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause to a person by whose benefit it is \ndone in good faith even without that person's consent, if the Circumstances are such that is \nimpo ssible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has \nno guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in \ntime for the thing to be done with benefit:  \nProvided  \nFirst:  That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or the \nattempting to cause death;  \nSecondly:  That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it \nknows to be likely to cause death, f or any purpose other than the preventing of death or \ngrievous, hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;  \nThirdly:  That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting \nto cause hurt for any purpose  other than the preventing of death or hurt;  \nFourthly:  That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of \nwhich offence it would not extend.  \n \nIllustrations  (a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. \nA not Intending Z's death but in good faith for Z's benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers \nhis power of judging for himself.

A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but \nnot intending to kill Z, and in good faith intending Z's benefit A's ball gives Z a mortal wound. A \nhas committed no offence.  \n  \n(c) A, a surgeon, sees child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be \nimmediately performed. There is no time to apply to the child's guardian. A performs the \noperation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending , in good faith, the child's benefit. A \nhas committed no offence.  \n  \n(d) A is in a house which is on fire with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child \nfrom the house -top, knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the chi ld, but not intending to \nkill the child and intending, in good faith, the child's benefit. Here even, if the child is killed by \nthe fall, A has committed no offence.  \n  \nExplanation:  Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of Sections 88,89 and 92.  \n  \n93. Communication made in good faith:  \nNo communication made in good faith is an offence by reason of any harm to the person to whom it \nis made for the benefit of that person.   \nIllustration  \nA, a surgeon, in good -faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient \ndies in consequence of the shock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that \nthe communication might cause the patient's death.  \n  \n94.

Act causing slight harm:  \nNothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or that it is known to \nbe likely to cause, any har m, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper \nwould complain of such harm.  \n  \n \nOf the right of Private Defence  \n96. Things done in private defence:  \nNothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence.  \n  \n97. Right of private defence of the body and of property:  \nEvery person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in Section 99, to defend;  \nFirst:  His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the \nhuman body;  \nSecondly:  The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, \nagainst any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, \nmischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief \nor criminal trespass.  \n   \n98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.:  \nWhen an act, which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the \nyouth, the want of maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the \nperson doing that act, or by reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person \nhas the same right of private defence against that act which he would have if the act were that \noffence.   \nIllustrations  \n(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence, but A has the \nsame right of private defence which he would have if Z were sane.  \n  \n(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z in good fait h, taking A for a \nhouse -breaker, attacks A. Here Z by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. \nBut A has the same right of private defence against Z, which he would have if Z were not acting \nunder that misconception.  \n  \n \n  \n99.

Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body:  \nThe right of private def ence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of \ndanger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may \nnot have been committed; and it continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body  \ncontinues.  \n  \n103.  When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death:  \nThe right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in Section 99, to \nthe voluntary Causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong -doer, if the offence, the \ncommitting of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasion s the exercise of the right, be an \noffence of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely: - \nFirst:  Robbery;  \nSecondly:  House -breaking by night;  \nThirdly:  Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel \nis used as a human dwelling or as a place for the custody of property;  \nFourthly:  Theft, mischief or house -trespass, under such circumstances as may reasonably c ause \napprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of \nprivate defence is not exercised.  \n \n  \n104.

He can not effectually exercise his right of \nprivate defence with out firing on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young \nchildren who are mingled with the mob. A comm its no offence if by so firing he harms any of the \nchildren.  \n  \n \nV \nOF ABETMENT  \n107.  Abetment of a thing:  \nA person abets the doing of a thing, who:  \nFirst:  Instigates any person to do that thing; or  \nSecondly:  Engages with one or more other person or, persons in any conspiracy for the doing of \nthat thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, And \nin order to the doing of that thing; or  Thirdly:  Intentionally aids, by any  act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.  \nExplanation 1: A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material \nfact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procures \na thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.  \n \nIllustration  \nA, a public officer, is authorized by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z. B, knowing \nthat fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully presents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes \nA to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C.  \nExplanation 2: Whoever, either prior to or at the time of commission of an act, does  anything in \norder to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is \nsaid to aid the doing of that act.  \n  \n108.  Abettor:  \nA person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the com mission of \nan act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an \noffence with the same Intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.  \nExplanation 1: The abetment of the illegal omission -of an act may amount to an offenc e although \nthe abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.  \nExplanation 2: To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should \nbe committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.  \n \nIllustrations  \n(a) A instigates 8 to murder C, B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder.  \n  \n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the \nwound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder.  \n  \nExplanation 3: It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor or \nany guilty intention or knowledge.  \n \nIllustrations  \n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an \noffence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the \nsame intention as A. Here A whether the act be committed or not, is guilty  of abetting an \noffence.  \n  \n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act \nwhich causes Z's death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A \nand thereby, cause Z's death. Here, though B was not capable by l aw of committing an offence, \nA is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing ah \noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.  \n  \n(c) A instigates B to set fire  to a dwelling -house, B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his \nmind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or \ncontrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of As instigation. B has committed no \noffence, but A is guilty, of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling house, and is liable \nto the punishment provided for that offence.  \n  \n(d) A intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out \nof Z's possession. A includes B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property \nout of Z's possession in good faith, believing it to be A's prope rty. B, acting under this \nmisconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But is guilty of \nabetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.  \n  \nExplanation 4: The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is \nalso an offence.  \n \nIllustration  A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and commits that \noffence in consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the \npunishment for murder; and as A instigated B to commit the of fence, A is also liable to the same \npunishment.  \nExplanation 5: It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that \nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages \nin the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.  \n \nIllustration  \nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then \nexplains the plan to C mentioning that a third person to administer the poison, but without \nmentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison and procures and delivers it to B for the \npurpose of its being used in the manner explained.

Theft:  \nWhoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person \nwithout that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft.  \nExplanation 1: A thing so long as it is attached to the ear th, not being movable property, is not the \nsubject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is served from the \nearth.  \nExplanation 2: A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft.  \nExplanati on 3: A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle, which prevented \nit from moving, or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.  \nExplanation 4: A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said  to move that animal, \nand to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal.  \nExplanation 5: The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be \ngiven either by the person in possession, or b y any person having for that purpose authority either \nexpress or implied.  \n \nIllustrations  \n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z's ground with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z's \npossession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such \ntaking, the has committed theft.  \n  (b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pockets, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here if A's intention \nbe dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent A has committed \ntheft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A.  \n  \n(c) A me ets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in \norder that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has \ncommitted theft of the treasure.  \n  \n(d) A being Z's servant and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with \nthe plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft.  \n  \n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall retur n. A \ncarries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in 2's possession. It could \nnot, therefore, be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft though he may \nhave committed criminal breach of trust.  \n  \n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring in Z's \npossession, and if A dishonestly removes it. A commits theft.  \n  \n(g) A finds a ring lying on the high -road, not in the possession of any person. A. by taki ng it, \ncommits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property,  \n  \n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the \nring immediately for fear of search and detection A hides the ring in a place where it is highly \nimprobable that it will ever be found by Z. with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding \nplace and soiling it when the toss is forgotten Here A. at the time of first moving the ring, \ncommits the theft.  \n  \n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing  to the jeweller, any debt for which the jewellers might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters \nthe shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Y's hand, and carries it away. Here A, though \nhe may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has  not committed theft, inasmuch as \nwhat he did was not done dishonestly.  \n  \n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security \nfor the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of \nthe property as security for his debt. he commits theft, inasmuc h as he takes it dishonestly.  \n  \n(k) Again, if A. having pawned his. watch to Z, takes it of Z's possession without Z's consent not \nhaving paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own \nproperty inasmuch as he tak es it dishonestly.  \n  \n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the intention \nof keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration Here A takes \ndishonestly: A has. therefore, committed theft.  \n  \n(m) A being on friendly terms with Z, goes to Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book \nwithout Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it. and with the intention of \nreturning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's imp lied consent to \nuse Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.  \n  \n(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to \nher husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away \nalms. If this was A's impression. A has not committed theft.  \n  \n(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives A valuable property, which A knows to belong to her \nhusband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the \nproperty dishonestly, he commits theft.    \n(p) A, in good faith believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property \nout of S's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.  \n  \n \n  \n379.

He thus \ninduces Z to give him money. A has committed extortion.  \n  \n(b) A threatens Z that he will keep Z's child in wrongful confinement, unless Z will sign and deliver \nto A a promissory -note binding Z, to pay certain money to A. Z signs and delivers the note. A has committed extortion.  \n  \n(c) A threatens to send club -men to plough up Z's field unless A will sign and deliver to 6 a bond \nbinding Z under a penalty to deliver certain produce to B, and thereby induces Z to sign and \ndeliver the bond. A has committed extortion.  \n  \n(d) A, by putting Z in fear of grievous hurt, dishonestly induces Z to sign or affix his seal to a blank \npaper and deliver it to A.
